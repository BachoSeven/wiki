## Tagging
- `picard` (MusicBrainz) (+`chomaprint` for AcousticID integration)

## Cue Splitting
- `unflac` works well ootb

## Audio Analysis
- `spek-wxgtk3` a simple acoustic spectrum analyser.

## Cool Players
### Graphical
- `deadbeef` is awesomely extensible and configurable
- `tauon-music-box` is very opinionated but extremely aesthetic; also supports streaming from spotify, jellyfin, plex...
### Terminal
- `mpd`+`ncmpcpp`, `mopidy` integration is also great
