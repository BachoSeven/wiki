## Histories

- `q/` opens an interactive search history
- `:<C-f>` opens an interactive command-line history; also through `q:`, but we reserved that for the fzf version of cli history.

## `z-*` stuff

- Spelling: `zg` good, `zw` bad; `zug` and `zuw` undo.
- `zt`, `zb`, `zz` to move view maintaining cursor;
- Folds, tl;dr: `za` to toggle fold(`zA` recursively), `zc` to close it(`zC` recursively), `zO` to open folds recursively(`zo`), `zd` to delete a fold(`zD` recursively), `zf` to create folds with movements, `zE` to eliminate folds entirely; `z[j-k]` are for navigating around folds.
